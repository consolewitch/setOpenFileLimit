setOpenFileLimit.command

This is a bash script that sets the open file limit in OS X 10.9
and later. If you want to distribute this around your office, I 
recommend downloading it, making it executable, and then putting
it in a dmg.

Note: I recommend against setting your hard max open file limit any
lower than 16384.  Even that is pretty low but you'll still be able
to recover.
